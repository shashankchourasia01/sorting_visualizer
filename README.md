 🌀 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer (Python + Pygame)
This is a Sorting Visualizer project built with Python using the Pygame library. It visually demonstrates how various sorting algorithms work step by step. The goal is to help learners understand how sorting algorithms operate internally using real-time animations.

🚀 Features
Visualizes popular sorting algorithms

Step-by-step animation of each comparison and swap

Real-time speed and value updates

Keyboard interaction for selecting sorting methods

Easy to extend with new algorithms

🛠 Built With
Python 3.x

Pygame - for graphical display and animations

📽️ Algorithms Included
🟦 Bubble Sort

🟨 Insertion Sort

🟧 Selection Sort

🟥 Merge Sort

🟩 Quick Sort

📷 Screenshots
Add screenshots here if possible to show the visualization in action.
